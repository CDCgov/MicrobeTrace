Searches over all CSV textual entries may be performed. Clicking on the column headers will sort all rows according to that column's data. Currently selected nodes in the network display will be sorted to the top of the spreadsheet. Selecting rows in the spreadsheet will highlight corresponding nodes in the network and geographic displays.
