You can generate a 3D version of the network view by selecting "3D Network" from the "View" dropdown in the main menu. The same network will then be rendered in 3D, which can sometimes be useful for further exploration.

In the 3D view, you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel. Although you cannot reposition nodes in the 3D view, you can rotate the network to find the position that gives you the best visualization of clusters and links.
 
As with the Network view, you can change the node and link settings in the 3D view. Select `Edit`, and `Settings` for options. You can change the color and size of nodes and show or hide singletons. You can also select the Links tab to change the edge settings in the 3D view. You can change the genetic distance cut-off value by specifying it in the textbox next to the Pruning option. You can also change the color of links and increase or decrease transparency using the slider.
