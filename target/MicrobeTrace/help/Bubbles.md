Sometimes you need to visualize demographic distributions within the network, but don't want to see the network. (This happens a lot in interactions with populations suffering from stigmatized illnesses: they don't want to see visual representations of possible/probable transmissions.) For these situations, we built Bubbles.

Bubbles is a force-directed diagram of all the nodes in a MicrobeTrace session, with none of the links. Unlike the network, you can't move individual nodes around with the mouse. However, you can move them around the screen to cluster with similar nodes according to variables in your dataset.

The image below displays node settings which can be mapped to a variable of your choice from the drop down menu.

Below is an example where nodes are colored by zip code.They are clustered by risk factor (X-axis) and county (Y-axis)

Bubbles is based on [this visualization](https://aaboyles.github.io/Bubbles/).
