If you'd like to help, we could definitely use your assistance!

1. [Documentation](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/wiki/z-Unwritten-Documentation-Requirements) - There's [this Wiki](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/wiki), [the Wiki](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/wiki) from [MicrobeTrace Classic](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace), and [the User Manual](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/blob/master/docs/MicrobeTrace_Manual.docx). It's all a bit disorganized.
2. Branding - Make a [non-terrible website](http://aaboyles.github.com/MicrobeTrace/), please.
3. Outreach - We may be able to attract more traffic by establishing a social media presence. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram?
4. Training - It would be really awesome to have a series of 10-minute walkthroughs of various MicrobeTrace workflows. It would also be really awesome to have a series of very short, 30-sec to 1-min MicrobeTrace reference videos (e.g. here's what it looks like when you change _this thing_). A library of those on Youtube would be _a-mazing_.
