MicrobeTrace is designed to pick up where [HIV-TRACE](https://github.com/veg/hivtrace) leaves off. Accordingly, it owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to the [ACME team](http://lab.hyphy.org/).

That said, MicrobeTrace shares effectively no common code with HIV-TRACE. Instead, the relevant functionality has been translated from C/C++ and Python into Javascript. And, like most modern Javascript projects, MicrobeTrace carries an enormous [list of dependencies](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/blob/master/package-lock.json). Thanks to all the developers who built and keep up these vital tools.

Any government-funded software development project is ultimately paid for by tax-payers. Our appreciation goes to everyone in (or subject to) the United States Federal Government who make this possible.

Finally, thanks to you for reading this, and hopefully using MicrobeTrace. I hope MicrobeTrace solves a problem for you. And, as always, if it doesn't (but you think it could and should) please [let us know!](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace/issues)
