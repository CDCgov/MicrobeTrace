## Operational Security


### Developer's Console

Once you reach out to us, we may occasionally set up a call so we can understand your issue with more depth and clarity, and possibly attempt to resolve it. One thing we may ask you to do is open up the developer's console in your browser. The developers console can be used to troubleshoot certain kinds of issues, which makes it extremely useful. However, it can also be dangerous, as hackers can use it to send your data to the outside world. To protect against this, MicrobeTrace provides a warning to be careful doing this sort of thing (with a link to this page). However, to be safest, if we (MicrobeTrace support) ask you to do put something in the developers' console, you should be able to do so with your computer disconnected from the internet. If you're speaking with someone other than MicrobeTrace support (e.g. *anyone* without a cdc.gov email address), and they instruct you to open the developers console, do not do it, and immediately email microbetrace@cdc.gov with as much detail as you can about the encounter, including any contact information you have for that person, how you came to know them, and what they asked you to do.

### Emailing Data

DO NOT E-MAIL PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO US. Doing so will result in your email being deleted and all relevant information security offices notified. It's a huge nuisance for us and liability for you--save us all the trouble and don't do it.
