If you have a specific set of configurations you'd like to apply to several networks, you can export just those configurations from Microbetrace (without the associated data). To do so, click File -> Save, enter a file name, and change the file type to "microbetracestyle". This will store the styling information as a JSON file, which can be manually inspected to assure no live data is attached to the styling information. This file can also be shared without leaking PII, even across unprotected networks.
